# ⭐ Stars of the Game – Player Analytics Dashboard 🏆

## 📌 Problem Statement
Sports analytics is becoming an essential part of identifying player performance, participation trends, and achievements. However, player-related data is often scattered, making it difficult to analyze insights such as gender distribution, state-wise participation, medal counts, and player levels.  
The goal of this project is to bring all these insights together in a **single interactive dashboard**.

- To design a **Power BI dashboard** that provides an overview of player demographics, participation, and performance.  
- To visualize insights that can help sports organizations, schools, and decision-makers understand patterns and encourage balanced participation.  
- To transform raw data into **actionable insights** using effective visual storytelling.

- Includes attributes like:  
  - Player ID  
  - Gender
